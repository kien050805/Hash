Hash Tables - CS 271


# CS 271 - Project 3: Hash Tables - Group 2

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement different Hash Tables, one with the doubly linked lists and the other with the a balanced binary tree. We also explore the

## Major Design Decisions
We use the DoublyLinkedList for each slot in the hash table in the HashMap class implementations. We also use 

## Group Challenges
I think there are no challenges when we are working together and implementing the algorithms.

## Individual Reflection
**James Bui**: I was primarily responsible for the implementation of the *Set* class and the *HashFunction*. I was also tasked to do the analysis of the hash maps.

## Known Issues
There are no known issues in our code.

## Additional Information
